# Data URI Alert (Chrome)
Data URI Alert is an extension for Chrome to alert users when they visit or are otherwise directed to a data URI. Such URL's can contain HTML and so HTML nbsp characters are displayed as space in the Chrome omnibox. This can allow an attacker to load the end of a URL with script tags at the end which will then be executed by the browser.

The extension is available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-uri-alert/gegnlclfnnjlmnbkicanpeoebndffnef
